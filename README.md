# Pine
The Pine game engine

Hi there, welcome to my game engine project. The purpose of this project is simply to learn and improve on my skills and understanding of building software systems in C++. I chose gaming engines as my topic of focus, however, I am NOT! looking to specialize in them. The purpose here is soly to practice and hone my understanding of build multilayers and multifeatures software.

I may pivot this project into a different kind of product so expect this repository to be a little messy for next first few months.

Also, full disclosure, I started out this project by initially basing it on the [Hazel Gaming Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), so the src in its early stages will look similar to Hazel's src. As my understanding of building software in C++ grows the more my src I will look different.

I will begin to diverge from "Hazel" with the following changes to come:

* Implement a different logging system (PENDING)

* Implement CMake (PENDING)

* Implement Google's unit testing framework (PENDING)
