# Pine
The Pine game engine

Hi there, welcome to my game engine personal project. The purpose of this project is simply to learn and improve on my skills and understanding of building software systems. I chose gaming engines as my topic of focus, however, I am looking to specialize in them. The purpose is soly to practice and hone my understanding of software developement and building complex systems.

Expect this repository to be messy for the first few months.

Also, full disclosure, this engine is based on the [Hazel Gaming Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), so the src in its early stages will look similar to Hazel's src. With that said I will be gradually branching off into doing my own thing as my understanding of building gaming engines grows.
